# todo-Restful-API
Generating Restful API using Django rest-framework

Using Django rest-framework created the api which is able to handle GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE requests.
I have also implemented the TokenAuthorization and Permission classes. So only authorized users can use this API. and in order to register for the use of API, I have also provided the registraion and login module. After login token is given to the user. All of the possible scenarios are checked in Postman platform and working fine.
